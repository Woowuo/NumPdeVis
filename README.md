Numeric Visualization of Partial Derivative Equation
## Problem Statement
### The current math apps and engineering simulation software have demonstrated the following problems:
1.	The current math apps in the market don’t provide numeric visualization of Laplace's Equation, Equation of Heat Conduction, and Wave Equation, but those 3 functions plays significant roles in engineering.
2.	In many other math apps, the software does not accept keyboard input, which slows down the users’ input speed.
3.	The other apps take a while to generate simulation graphs, which demonstrates the performance issue.
4.	The mainstream apps do not provide history look-up, so users may lose history data.
5.	The simulation software is generally too heavy to use.
1.2 Background Information
The current math apps, in general, provide analytical solutions based on Laplace’s equation and the other 2 functions. But none of those apps provides direct visualization of the numeric solution. However, in engineering, the visualization of the foregoing 3 functions holds significant engineering value across various domains. 
For Laplace’s equation, engineers use it to analyze electric fields, capacitors, and conductors. 
And for the equation of heat conduction, plays a significant role in designing efficient heat exchangers for applications like refrigeration, air conditioning, and power plants. 
The wave equation enables us to visualise sound waves and assists in designing concert halls, auditoriums, and recording studios. 
For the professional simulation software, numeric visualization is implemented. However, the size of the software is large, which is very inconvenient. 
Therefore, developing such a compact software of visualizing those 3 equations is very prospective for simulation work.
